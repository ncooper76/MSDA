## The Physics of Breaking Distance

The kinetic energy (KE) of a car is $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where 'm' is mass of the car and 'v' is speed. For KE in Joules (J), mass needs to be in kilograms (Kg) and speed in meters per second (m/s).

For a car to slow down while breaking, work must be done on the wheels of the car by the breaks. Work (W) is defined as $W = F*d$ where 'F' is the force applied by the breaks and 'd' is stopping distance of the car. Since the frictional force of the break is anti-parallel to the displacement of the car, $cos(-\pi) = -1$. The negative sign in this case tells us that work is transferring energy from the system (the car) to its surroundings via heat. The negative sign can be dropped in this analysis without loss of information, as it will cancel out in the steps below. For work to be in Joules (J), force must be in Newtons (N) and distance in meters (m).

Note also drivers tend to apply steady pressure to the break pedal when stopping, we can treat breaking for as a constant.

By the Work-Energy Theorem $\Delta KE = W$:
$$
\Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i\\
 \text{The car stops.}\\
KE_f = 0\space J  \\
- KE_i = W  \\
\space\text{Recall work is negative.}\\
KE_i = W \\
\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = F*d \\
d = \frac{1}{2}\frac{m}{F}v_i^2 \\
\text{F, m and 1/2 are all constant, we can absorb them into a constant C.} \\
\text{Note F/m is acceleration so C has units:} \frac{s^2}{m}\\
d = C*v_i^2 \\
\text{The units of d are:} \frac{s^2}{m}*\frac{m^2}{s^2} = m
$$

There are no physical negative solutions to the above equation, so a simple linear regression will tell us the two variables are correlated. However, we see that distance is quadratic with respect to speed so a linear model is invalid. However we will proceed with the analysis to highlight the importance of using data visualizations and residual analysis to test validity of linear models. 

## The Linear Regression

Linear regression is done very simply in R using lm(). The data generated by the model will be saved in a variable 'fit'.

```{r cars-mdl, eval=TRUE}
summary(cars$speed) #looks like mph
summary(cars$dist) #looks like feet 
fit <- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
summary(fit)
```

If we didn't know better we'd say that there is an incredibly signifcant linear correlation, as the p value is much less than 0.05, and call it quits.  But we know that this isn't the case.

## Data Visualization

```{r d_v, eval=TRUE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, xlab = "Initial Speed (mph)", ylab = "Breaking Distance (ft)", col=' darkviolet')
abline(fit, col = "gold3")
```

In this case the data visualization isn't much help in determining that the linear model isn't valid. In other fields, this would look like a good fit.

## Residuals

Linear models work as long as residuals are normally distributed and appear random when plotted against the independant varaible.

```{r res, eval=TRUE}
res <- resid(fit)
summary(res)
hist(res, xlab = "Residuals of Distance")
```

There is right skew to the Residuals, it doesn't seem bad enough to invalidate the linear model outright.

```{r res-plot}
plot(fitted(fit), resid(fit),  col = 'steelblue4')
qqnorm(res)
qqline(res)
```

The residuals here do not appear random. They seem to grow in range as the initial speed increases, and are not uniformly scattered around zero. The Normal Q-Q plot also shows deviation from the thoeretical values at the upper quantiles. Given this, the skewness of the residuals, and the underlying physics, a linear model is not valid.
