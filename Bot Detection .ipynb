    "## NLP and Bot Detection\n",

    "We will begin to see an increase in [chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10076) as an interface for recommender systems.  If such bots elicit feedback from people to refine their recommendations, they may be particularly susceptible to malicious chat bots themselves. In fact, such technology [exists for yelp](https://theverge.com/2017/8/31/16232180/ai-fake-reviews-yelp-amazon) however, the subtle difference is the yelp bot produces static content meant to be read by humans whereas the bot-to-bot communication may never be read by a human. \n",

    "\n",
    "It seems to build a robust system that would not be susceptible to large scale manipulation would to build tests using NLP that may check if the recommender bot is talking to a real person or a malicious bot. Other forms of analysis may also be used to check origin and frequency of the attack. Humans can only type so fast.\n"
